convoluted neural network
ensure learning rate is just right
- too low: take too much time
- too high: undefined behaviours
confusion matrix
overfitting
- overreliance on obvious features (especially similar ones)
- if the input data is too similar
- the model will only learn to match a certain orientation instead
  of the overall shape
data biasness
- unequal amount of data
- 2 classes:
  - class 1: 10000 samples
  - class 2: 5 samples
- confidence bias towards class 1
